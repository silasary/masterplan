Masterplan lets you build combat encounters, displaying the 
    creature statblocks and the encounter XP value; XP targets are shown and inappropriate challenges are highlighted, and creatures can be levelled up and down as desired. Masterplan can generate encounters randomly or semi-randomly using the DMG encounter templates or an encounter deck. Masterplan can even 
    run the combat encounter, keeping track of hit points, conditions and ongoing damage.
