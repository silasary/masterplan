    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The last official update (11.11) for Masterplan was in 2013, and contained several major usability issues.</li>
        <li>The original domain, <a href="http://masterplan.habitualindolence.net/">http://masterplan.habitualindolence.net/</a> expired in March 2016.</li>
        <li>After enduring a number of frustrating and fatal crashes, I attempted to contact Andy through all available channels, with no luck.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Why decompile Masterplan?</h3>
    The last official release, 11.11, has several breaking issues, which have been slowly getting on my nerves over the past several years.<br/>
    These included random crashes, and major memory leaks.<br/>
    At first, I used ILSpy as an attempt to identify and avoid the crashes I'd been experiencing.<br/>
    Noticing several glaring errors (including 115+ points where a memory leak would occur), I decompiled it and fixed them for personal use <br/>
    
    <h3>Why put it online?</h3>
    A couple weeks ago, I mentioned that I'd been cleaning it up to a couple of friends in my local GM group.<br />
    They asked for a copy, having also noticed the same shortcomings, and one of them put that build online. <br />
    As such, I decided that, as I was already mirroring 11.11, I may as well start putting my 11.12 build up here <br />
    I figured that, if Andy Aiken is still alive, and really doesn't want me messing with Masterplan, he would be able to contact me and ask me to take it down <br />

    <h3>So what now?</h3>
    I'm still trying to work out how the codebase was put together, and it's currently full of all kinds of decompilation junk <br />
    I'm going to continue to familiarize myself with it, then start adding features based on my own personal feature wishlist. <br />
